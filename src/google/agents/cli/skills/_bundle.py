"""Locate the bundled agents-cli skills.

The canonical skills live in ``data/`` next to this file
(``src/google/agents/cli/skills/data/``). Because that directory is inside the
package, it's automatically bundled in the wheel - so ``agents-cli setup`` can
install skills with no ``git`` and no network.

This module is just a small helper to locate the skills dir based on a relative
path from this module.
