"""FastAPI app serving the agent over the A2A protocol.

The agent is exposed through the Agent2Agent (A2A) JSON-RPC surface at
``/a2a/{name}``, with its Agent Card at the well-known path. This mirrors the
contract used by agents-cli's ADK A2A agents, so the deploy entrypoint
(``uvicorn app.fast_api_app:app``) and ``agents-cli run --mode a2a`` keep
working unchanged.

For the richest *local* LangGraph experience (graph inspection, streaming,
threads), ``agents-cli playground`` runs ``langgraph dev``, which also serves
the A2A protocol natively.
